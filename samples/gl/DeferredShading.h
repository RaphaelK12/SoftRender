/*
 * The reality is that your GPU and GLSL are really bad at optimizing loops and branches.
 * The reason for this is that shader execution on the GPU is highly parallel and most architectures
 * have a requirement that for large collection of threads they need to run the exact same shader code
 * for it to be efficient. This often means that a shader is run that always executes all branches of
 * an if statement to ensure the shader runs are the same, making our previous radius check optimization
 * completely useless; weâ€™d still calculate lighting for all light sources!
